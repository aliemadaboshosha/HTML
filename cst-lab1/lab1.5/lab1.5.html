<tr bgcolor="ddffdd"><td> <h2 align="center" ><font color="0001ff">Here are some of my thoughts about creating this logo design:</font></h2></td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="white"><td>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>I created this logo in Adobe illustrator, I primarily used the pen tool and the selection tool to modify points,I also used the circle shape tools. </li>
<br>
<li>I chose to use an analogous color scheme for this logo , I chose the colors blue , teal and green,these colors remind me of water and fit well with the icon .</li>
<br>
<li>I feel this Logo appeals to the target audience for several reasons , The name of the business ,whale design Studio,has a quirky sort of feel . the icon fits with this quirky kind of vibe, and it has a happy little smile that seems inviting. i also feel the icon is aesthetically pleasing and a little different from other design logos that i have seen, overall,it gives the kind of feeling that i would personally be drawn to if i were looking for design services .
</li>
<br>
<li>This logo incorporates the following design skills: tastfull typography, asymmetry, and color theory, this logo uses tasteful typography in the font choice and the way the fonts contrast with each othe, the design is asymmetrical,which adds visual interest, while still remaining balanced, the colors used work well with the icon still creating contrast .
</li>
